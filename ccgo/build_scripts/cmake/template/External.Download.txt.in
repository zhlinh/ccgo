## External Dependency Download Script
# This minimal CMakeLists.txt is generated dynamically by External.CMakeLists.txt.in
# Its sole purpose is to download and extract an external library at configure time.
#
# When executed with "cmake --build .", it downloads the library without building it.
# The actual build happens later when add_subdirectory() is called in External.CMakeLists.txt.in.

# Project with NONE language (no compiler needed for download-only step)
project(${COMM_EXTERNAL_NAME}-external NONE)

# Use CMake's ExternalProject module for downloading
include(ExternalProject)
ExternalProject_Add(${COMM_EXTERNAL_NAME}
  URL               "${COMM_EXTERNAL_DOWNLOAD_URL}"    # Download URL (ZIP from GitHub)
  SOURCE_DIR        "${COMM_EXTERNAL_SOURCE_DIR}"     # Where to extract sources
  BINARY_DIR        "${COMM_EXTERNAL_BUILD_DIR}"       # Build directory (unused at download time)
  CONFIGURE_COMMAND "${COMM_EXTERNAL_CONFIGURE_COMMAND}"  # Empty: skip configure
  BUILD_COMMAND     "${COMM_EXTERNAL_BUILD_COMMAND}"      # Empty: skip build
  INSTALL_COMMAND   "${COMM_EXTERNAL_INSTALL_COMMAND}"    # Empty: skip install
  TEST_COMMAND      "${COMM_EXTERNAL_TEST_COMMAND}"       # Empty: skip tests
)
# Note: All commands are empty because we only want to download and extract.
# The actual configuration and build happen when the external library is
# added as a subdirectory in External.CMakeLists.txt.in.
